# Noteworthy Projects
 Some noteworthy projects that are slightly more advanced than the "Simple" sections.

- Hash List: Adds the phrase you type to a hash list. Doesnt do anything else just that. :joy:

- Palindrome: Will determine whether or not the word you enter is a Palindrome (ie. the same forwards and backwards, like racecar.)

- Sentence: You enter an initial sentence and you can shuffle it, read back the intial sentence, or change it.

- SymbolTable: Uses the program Demo.java to determine a list of each identifier, the line number of the first occurance of each identifier. It then sorts them alphabetically. Try with your own file just rename it demo.java and run SymbolTable.java in the same folder!

- TimeComplexityCalculator: Asks for an integer and outputs all the time complexieties based on their mathematical formulas.

Again feel free to try these out as much or as little as you would like lol. These projects are better than some in my opinion and show a wide variety of skills just not quite my favorite.
